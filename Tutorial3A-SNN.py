This tutorial demonstrates how to simulate a simple spiking neural network using the Brian2 library.
We will create a network of 100 neurons, each with a defined membrane potential that evolves over time.
The neurons will fire action potentials when their membrane potential exceeds a certain threshold,
and we will visualize the spiking activity and firing rates based on their baseline potentials.

Task 1: Spontaneous activity
Some biological neurons fire spontaneously without external input, for example, brainstem neurons that drive breathing.
This intrinsic excitability is modelled using the baseline membrane potential `v0`: the higher it is, the more often the neuron fires on its own.
This first example builds a group of independent neurons, each with different baseline membrane potentials, ranging from  0 to v0_max with growing neuron index.

Run the simulation and observe at which times is each of the neurons firing and how the baseline potential controls the firing rate.

Adjust the tau parameter, how does the activity change for tau = {2.0, 10.0, 50.0}?
